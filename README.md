# GangRampage Mod: Enhanced Edition

An enhanced version / modified version of the original GangRampage Mod, which can be found [here](https://www.gtainside.com/en/gta4/mods/189518-gangrampage-mod/). This aims to improve the script with new features and tweaks. As well, this is my first time messing with C#.

### Requirements:
Now this is kinda tricky since different versions and what not, but my game version is **1.0.8.0**, using a [1.0.8.0 ScriptHookDotNet patch](https://gtaforums.com/topic/946154-release-gtaiv-net-scripthook-v1718-support-for-gta-iv-1080-and-eflc-1130-by-arinc9-zolika1351/)

So, it may work with 1.0.7.0 and Complete Edition (Maybe???? I do not know. I don't play CE)

### Installation:
Place the  `scripts` folder inside `GTAIV`. Should be `Grand Theft Auto IV/GTAIV/scripts/gangRampageV2.cs`

# New Gangs
- **LCPD Gang**
- **Stripper Gang** (Gag gang)
- **Service Gang** (Gag gang, Food workers, TW@T, RockStar)
- **Local People Gang** (Essentially Civilians)
- **Everyone** (All gangs will be spawned)

# Gang Tweaks
- The **Russian Gang 2** has been removed and combined into **Russian Gang 1**.
- Gang members now drop cash upon being defeated.
- Elite hitmen have a chance to spawn with armor.
- Gangs now have blips added back for better tracking.
- Regular Hitmen and Elite Hitmen are differentiated by blip colors. Regular Hitmen have red blips, while Elite Hitmen have yellow blips (or pink if playing TBoGT).

# Gameplay Tweaks
- The interval for spawning enemies has been increased.
- Enemies health has been slightly increased, and max health will be random.
- The number of occupants in vehicles is randomized, rather than being fixed at 2.
- Vehicles driven by Hitmen will now face the player upon spawning and will gain a small acceleration boost to catch up.
- Vehicle Hitmen will drive more recklessly, attempting to get to you, they will not travel 65 MPH, instead will do 105 MPH.
- Gang Hitmen will now have randomized prop attachments (Hats, Glasses) but rather done poorly.

# Episodic Specific Features
In the episodes "The Lost and Damned" and "The Ballad of Gay Tony", players can expect to encounter Episodic content for the gangs. Vehicles, weapons, and peds. These provide more variety.

Here are some example changes for "The Ballad of Gay Tony":
- **The North Holland Hustlers**: Now equipped with the Golden Uzi.
- **Russian Mobsters**: Armed with the .44 Pistol and the SAW, these mobsters are not to be taken lightly.
- **LCPD**: Equipped with the Assault SMG (P90), SAW and Assault Shotgun (AA-12), along with new vehicles.
  
The Lost and Damned:
- **Angels of Death**: New peds, New weapons, New vehicles.
- **The Lost M.C**: Same as above.

# Featured soon
- Allies that will assist Niko, Johnny, and Luis.
- Addition of more gangs.
